The included Web Player Demo level uses the CombineChildren script by Unity for optimization.
This script combines all meshes of the same material into a single mesh and is included to improve the framerate in the demo level when using Unity Free.
If you are using Unity Pro and have Static Batching enabled, remove or disable this script. Otherwise the level will mysteriously vanish when playing!
If you are using Unity Pro, I highly recommend instead using Static Batching and Occlusion Culling to optimize performance.
You are free to use the level as you see fit, as it is part of the package.
